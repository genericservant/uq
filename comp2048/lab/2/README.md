Intro:

	Looking at some videos by numberphile and computerphile on utbe but havent really understood.
	Damn these brits cant explain for shit trying ucdavis lecture by some nerd from nsa says he works as a
	cryptologic mathematician / crypto analyst (yeah i cant spell for shit) David Perry, teaches cryptology
	and taught at lanchester penselvania at franklin marshal campus youtube.com/watch?v=ncL2Fl6prH8

Monoalphabetinc Substution Ciphers :: plain enclish __ letter for letter substution cipher:

	scrambellnig of the alphabet : premutation of the alphabet 26!

	a simple Caesar is a shift and there are 26 different to choose a shift

	Frequency analysis by arabs in 900ce

	The Vigenere Cipher: requires a agreed upon keyword thats written multipletime and each plaintext letter
				is mapped to its corresponding Caesar shift
				i.e. T mapes to V as A mapes to C i.e a shift of 3 letters
				H mapes to S as A mapes to L a shift of 10 lettes

		plaintext:	THEREISNOLIMIT...
